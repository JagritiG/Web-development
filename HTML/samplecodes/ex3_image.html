		<h2>Adding Images</h2>
		<p>To add an image into the page you need to use an &#60<strong>img</strong>&#62 element. This is an empty element (which means there is no closing tag). It must carry the following attributes:</p>
		<ul>
			<li> The <b>src</b> attribute tells the browser where it can find the image file. This will usually be a relative URL pointing to an image on your own site.</li>
			<li> The <b>alt</b> attribute provides a text description of the image which describes the image if you cannot see it.</li>
			<li> The <b>title</b> attribute provides additional information about the image.</li>
			<li> The <b>height</b> attribute specifies the height of the image in pixels..</li>
			<li> The <b>width</b> attribute specifies the width of the image in pixels.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>For Example,</p>
		<img src="../images/merigold.jpg" alt="flower" title="This image is taken from website." width="400" height="350" />
